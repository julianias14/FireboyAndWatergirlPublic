Recursion assignment for CS111 (Introduction to Computer Science) classes at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. The characters recursively seek a path, inspired by the classic game of the same name. Students are meant to implement a recursive function using conditionals to check for safe paths forward while keeping track of visited paths.
